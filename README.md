# Skeleton REPL Projects

Preconfigured starter projects for use with Stackblitz and SvelteLab.

## How To

Use these links to spin up a quick instance of Skeleton in your browser to provide reproductions of any issues you encounter. Please note that you need to be signed in, press save, before generating the link to share with us on Discord. Please note: You will probably have to remove any custom components you have made as well as dependencies for it to work properly (or you can edit the project to add them in if absolutely necessary).
